Recommended Approach
Yes, cloning is the ideal starting point. Here's why and how to structure it:
1. Replit Project Structure
* Clone this current project to preserve all your astrological calculation logic
* Create a new public Replit for the free version
* Keep this current version as your premium service
2. Free Version Features
* Birth data entry form (simple, clean interface)
* One-click "Generate My Cosmic Playlist" button
* Weekly astrological playlist with song explanations per planet/transit
* Free Spotify integration (users can view playlists, get explanations)
* Optional Spotify export (requires their login for playlist creation)
3. Freemium Monetization Strategy
Free Tier:
* 1 playlist per week
* Basic astrological explanations
* View-only playlist (can copy song names manually)
Premium Upgrade Path:
* "Unlock Full Cosmic Experience" button/card
* Leads to splash page explaining premium benefits:
    * Unlimited playlists
    * Detailed birth chart analysis
    * Mood tracking & correlation analytics
    * AI chat for personalized cosmic guidance
    * Direct Spotify export
    * Weekly horoscopes & transit details
4. Technical Implementation
Simplified Architecture:
* Remove chat interface (focus on single-purpose playlist generation)
* Keep all your astrological calculation services
* Simplify to: Birth Form → Generate Button → Playlist Display
* Add upgrade CTA cards throughout the experience
Spotify Compliance:
* Use Spotify Web API for track search and playlist creation
* Free accounts can create playlists (30-second previews)
* Premium accounts get full track playback
* Your app just facilitates playlist creation, fully compliant
Would you like me to help you plan out the specific pages and user flow for this free version? I can also research current Spotify API requirements to ensure full compliance.
The key is making the free version valuable enough to attract users, but limited enough that the premium upgrade feels worthwhile. Your current astrological calculation engine is the perfect foundation for both versions!
