# Sonifyr - Astrological Music Curation

Sonifyr creates personalized Spotify playlists based on the weekly planetary transits across your birth chart, combining celestial insights with music recommendations.

## Examples

✨🎧 <b>With a little tweaking of the code, I was able to create a playlist for a specific time frame:</b>
This Cosmic Playlist is in Honor of Mary Shelley's 228th Birthday! My AI Astrologer analyzed the Astrological influences on Mary Shelley the Summer she created Frankenstein's Monster in 1816 and matched it with songs to express and transmute those wild and creative energies. Salut Legend!
[The Year Without A Summer](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/4R1B1C92Lqz7G6AsGTRFwK)

✨🎧 <b>This next one is based on the developers Natal Chart:</b>
[Celestial Rhythms of the Scorpionic Archer](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/52lsAOuqzFMhgyOF90L7vH)
A soulful journey through intense emotions and philosophical musings, this playlist harmonizes Scorpio's depth with Sagittarius' quest for truth, under today's cosmic energies. - Generated by Sonifyr based on your cosmic energy
